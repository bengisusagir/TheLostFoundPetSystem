## Overview

The Lost & Found Pet System is a desktop application designed to help users register, manage, and track lost or found pets.

The system provides a graphical interface and uses a local SQLite database for persistent data storage.

This project demonstrates:
- GUI-based desktop application development
- Database design and integration
- Modular Python architecture
- Collaborative software development

---

## Features

- Register lost pets
- Register found pets
- View stored pet records
- Persistent local database storage
- Simple and intuitive graphical interface
- Basic localization support

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI framework)
- SQLite3 (database)
- Modular programming principles

No external libraries are required beyond standard Python libraries.

---

## How It Works

- main.py initializes and launches the GUI.
- gui/ contains user interface components.
- dblib.py handles all database queries and interactions.
- database_setup.py creates and initializes the database schema.
- languages.py provides localization support.

The system follows a clear separation between:
- User Interface Layer
- Database Layer
- Application Logic

## Learning Objectives

This project was built to:

- Practice GUI development in Python
- Implement persistent storage with SQLite
- Apply modular software design principles
- Work collaboratively using Git & GitHub
